### Privacy Policy for Vlogin Extension

#### 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how the Vlogin Extension ("we," "our," or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our browser extension. By using the extension, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

#### 2. Information We Collect
The extension may collect the following types of information:

- *Credentials*: The extension stores your login credentials (such as usernames and passwords) locally on your device. These credentials are encrypted and not transmitted to any external servers.
- *Preferences*: User preferences related to the extension’s settings (e.g., auto-fill and login preferences) are stored locally.

#### 3. How We Use Your Information
The information collected is used solely for the purpose of enhancing your experience with the extension. Specifically, we use your information to:

- Automatically fill in login forms and submit them on your behalf.
- Remember your preferences and settings for future sessions.
  
We do not share, sell, or transfer your information to any third parties.

#### 4. Data Security
We are committed to protecting your information. The extension uses encryption to store your credentials securely on your device. No data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party services. However, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security, and users are responsible for maintaining the security of their devices.

#### 5. Permissions
The extension requires certain permissions to function properly:

- *Storage*: To save credentials and user preferences securely.
- *ActiveTab*: To interact with the currently active tab and ensure the extension only operates on the relevant website.
- *Scripting*: To inject scripts into the login page for auto-filling and automating the login process.
- *Host Permissions*: To identify and interact with specific domains where the extension’s functionality is needed.

These permissions are strictly scoped to ensure the extension operates securely and only as needed.

#### 6. User Control
You have full control over the extension’s operation:

- You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time.
- You can clear stored credentials and preferences through your browser settings.

#### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
